# 100 Days of Rust

A day-by-day learning repository for Rust — notes, exercises, examples, and solutions collected across 100 days of practice.

## Overview

This workspace contains a sequence of daily lessons and projects to learn Rust progressively. Each day includes a short README, examples, exercises, and solutions where applicable.

## Quickstart

Prerequisites: `rustup` (installs `rustc` and `cargo`) and a POSIX shell or Windows terminal.

Clone the repo, then run an example project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Dawaman43/100-days-of-rust.git
cd 100-days-of-rust
cd days/days-01-20/day-01/examples/hello_world
cargo run
```

Or open the desired day folder and run the example or solution with `cargo run`.

## Repository layout

- `days/` — all day folders grouped in ranges (e.g., `days-01-20`).
  - `day-01/` — contains `README.md`, `examples/`, `exercises/`, `solutions/`.
- `projects/` — capstone and mini-projects.
- `resources/` — books, articles, tools, and links.

## Contributing

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines. Typical contributions:

- Improvements to daily notes
- Additional examples or exercises
- Fixes to existing solutions

Please open issues or PRs on the GitHub repository to collaborate.
